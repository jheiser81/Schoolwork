Exercise 1)
Using Input/Output and If statements
Take a User input, Put it into a variable and call it "beverage"
using if statements, check if the value of "beverage" is coffee, tea or soda. Print the value. if the beverage is none of those print water
           Case1) Input = coffee
                        output = coffee

           Case 2) Input = Juice
                          output = Water 
Beverage = UserInput
if (Beverage == Coffee)
      Print Coffee
else if (Beverage == Tea)
      Print Tea
else if (Beverage == Soda)
      Print Soda
else 
      Print water
end program

Exercise 2)
Using Input/Output and If statements
Take User input that is a number, Put it into a variable, and using if statements, determine if the number is even or odd
           Case1) Input = 5
                        output = Odd

           Case 2) Input = 22
                          output = Even 
NumberToCheck = UserInput
if (NumberToCheck is evenly divisible by 2 )
      Print Even
else 
      Print Odd
end program

Exercise 3)
Using Input/Output and If statements
Take User input that is a number, Put it into a variable, and using if statements, determine if the is evenly divisible by 3 or evenly divisible by 5. When the number is evenly divisible by 3 print "fizz". When the number is evenly divisible by 5 print "buzz". When it is evenly divisible y both print "FizzBuzz". in all other circumstances print "No fizz or buzz"
           Case1) Input = 25
                        output = Buzz

           Case 2) Input = 30
                          output = FizzBuzz 
           Case 3) Input = 12
                          output = Fizz 
           Case 4) Input = 11
                          output = No fizz or buzz
NumberToCheck = UserInput
if ( NumberToCheck % 3 == 0 AND NumberToCheck % 5 == 0 )
      Print FizzBuzz
else if ( NumberToCheck % 3 == 0 )
      Print Fizz
else if ( NumberToCheck %  5== 0 )
      Print Buzz
else 
     Print No fizz or buzz
end program
