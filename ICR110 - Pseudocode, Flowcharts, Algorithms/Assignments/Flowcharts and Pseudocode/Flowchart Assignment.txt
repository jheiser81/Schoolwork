Exercise 1)
Using Input/Output and If statements
Take User input that is a number, Put it into a variable, and using if statements, determine if the number is even or odd
           Case1) Input = 5
                        output = Odd

           Case 2) Input = 22
                          output = Even 
NumberToCheck = UserInput
if (NumberToCheck is evenly divisible by 2 )
      Print Even
else 
      Print Odd
end program

Exercise 2)
Using Input/Output and If statements
Take User input that is a number, Put it into a variable, and using if statements, determine if the is evenly divisible by 3 or evenly divisible by 5. When the number is evenly divisible by 3 print "fizz". When the number is evenly divisible by 5 print "buzz". When it is evenly divisible y both print "FizzBuzz". in all other circumstances print "No fizz or buzz"
           Case1) Input = 25
                        output = Buzz

           Case 2) Input = 30
                          output = FizzBuzz 
           Case 3) Input = 12
                          output = Fizz 
           Case 4) Input = 11
                          output = No fizz or buzz
NumberToCheck = UserInput
if ( NumberToCheck % 3 == 0 AND NumberToCheck % 5 == 0 )
      Print FizzBuzz
else if ( NumberToCheck % 3 == 0 )
      Print Fizz
else if ( NumberToCheck %  5== 0 )
      Print Buzz
else 
     Print No fizz or buzz
end program
