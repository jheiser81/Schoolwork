Exercise 1:
•Look back at the 100 random number array
we made. 
•Move the find largest, find smallest,
sum, average, and the (even, odd, zero counter) into separate subprograms.
Exercise 2:
•Make a Mini-ATM.
•Using a function and subroutine, use the
function to return the amount withdrawn as a messagebox. Use the subroutine to print the balance
in a message box. Print the balance when after you withdraw
•Output is on the slides, but feel free
to use your own design

Extra:
Hacker2000:
the game is about a secret agent that is breaking into a server room. The agent has a super
hacker 2000 that allows you to read 3 random numbers which are based on your difficulty*. In your program you will add and multiply the
same three numbers and you will write to your user the following:

    You are a secret agent breaking into a LEVEL (Difficulty 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) server room
    There are three numbers in the code
    The Code Multiplies to:_____
    The Code Adds to:_____
(
examples: 
the random numbers would be 2,3,4 
add = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
multiply = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
)
The player has 3 guesses
if they guess one number wrong you will output "You died horribly!"
if they guess right output "You broke The code!! On to the next level"
