#pragma region Project Idea : Online Store System
/*
Description:
Build an online store system that allows users to browse and purchase products.The system should have different components such as a product catalog, shopping cart, user authentication, and order processing.Each component can be implemented as a separate class with well - defined interfaces.

Components:

1) Create the Product Catalog component:
Implement a class to represent the product catalog.
Define the necessary attributes for each product, such as name, price, description, and stock quantity.
Implement methods to search for products, view product details, and add products to the shopping cart.

2) Build the Shopping Cart component:
Implement a class to manage the user's shopping cart.
Design the cart to hold multiple products and keep track of the total price.
Create methods to add / remove items from the cart, update quantities, and interact with the product catalog.

3) Develop the User Authentication component:
Build a class to handle user authentication.
Implement methods for user registration, login / logout, and credential validation.
Store user information like username, password, and email.

4) Implement the Order Processing component:
Create a class to manage order processing.
Design methods to generate order summaries, calculate the total cost, and manage the order status.
Interact with the shopping cart to retrieve selected items and with user authentication to associate orders with users.

5) Create the User Interface:
Implement a user interface for the online store system.
Design the UI to allow users to browse the product catalog, add items to the shopping cart, view cart contents, place orders, and manage their account.
Depending on your preference, you can create a console - based interface or a graphical user interface(GUI).*/
