14 seconds of thought is equal to 2000 hours of action

What does this mean?
If I ask you to move a 1000-pound slab of granite and you just jump in with action you would just start pushing it. Over many days and weeks (2000 hours) you may move it. Now with 14 seconds of thought, you may think to use a pully system and a truck and move it in about 20 min. 

Below are problem-solving videos so you can use more thought and less action. You can also find your own:

Don't confuse activity with accomplishment. Think and you will get more done. Think like a programmer.
