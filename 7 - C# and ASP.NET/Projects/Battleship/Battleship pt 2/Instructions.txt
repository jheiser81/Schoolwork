1) Make a random Assignment Function
2) Make a Display ships function

Random Assignment Function:     Use a random number generator to make random numbers.
    Use a data structure called "HashSet" lines 16 and 17 in my code (do research)
    loop while the HashSet.Count has less than 8 numbers generate random numbers for playerLocation
    add a location x and y  
    while the HashSet.Count has less than 8 numbers generate random numbers for ComputerLocation
    add a location x and y          
Display Ships Function:

    Convert your HashSet.ToList() for the playerLocation, List is another data structure that acts like an array
    Change the image location from water to ships
    Convert your HashSet.ToList() for the computerLocation, List is another data structure that acts like an array
    Change the image location from water to ships


End result:

You should have random ships on your gameboard every time you start the form.
