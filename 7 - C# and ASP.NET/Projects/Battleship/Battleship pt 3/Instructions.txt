Complete the functions in the code I have provided, You can use these on your own code or just finish mine

Final requirements:

-There must be two game boards, one for the computer, and one for the player
-Random assignment of the ships
-Random turn assignment 
-display the player ships (you can display the computer ships for testing)
-Player ships can be seen, computer ships are hidden and look just like water
-When the player clicks on the computer gameboard the water will either change to an explosion or a miss image
-After the player finishes their turn, the computer turn executes automatically
-After each turn, there is a win check to see who won
-If there is a winner, the game resets and a new game will start

Marks will be given based on


-10% for printing the gameboards
-10% for random assignment and random turn
-10% for displaying ships
-15% for Player click
-15% for Computer turn 
-15% for win check 
-15% for the game reset
-10% for variables and functions with descriptive names that are human-readable (The only valid measurement of code quality is WTF/minute - Uncle Bob on clean code )

Add Comments for my code if you used it
Extras to add after submission:

-Add number and letter to indicate the columns and rows
-Add levels; if it is easy the random number will shoot everywhere, the harder it gets the random numbers are generated closer to the ships.
-Make one ship across 2-3 spaces
