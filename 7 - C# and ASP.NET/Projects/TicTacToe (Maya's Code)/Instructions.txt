I have provided my code. If you plan to use it, please write comments explaining what the code is doing. If you plan to use tutorials, go through 3-5 different tutorials, then write your own code based on the logic they provided. 

Make a Flow Chart, Algorithm, or pseudoCode for what TicTacToe Includes
Look at the attached code to see how you can make a game board and take in user input to alter the game board values
The final result will Include:
3 x 3 matrix using strings, as I did in the code sample attached
Initial Turn Decision (Random or not random, up to you)
Button Click Event to change X and Y
Check Valid Move
Turn Function 
Win Check (Win, Draw)
Reset game


Extra Ideas Once you have submitted and finished:

1) Make it a picture box array (Like the array from the airline reservation system )
2) Add a computer-generated turn
3) make tic tac toe in VB and Javascript
4) make the airline reservation in C# and Javascript
