//4) Using user inputs and template literals, make a Mad Lib that fills in the blanks and prints:
//Hi! Last week I went _____. My friend ____ and I had so much _____. There were ____
//and _____. When we saw it we felt really ____. You should come next time!

// let activity = "to the zoo"
// let buddy = "Nick"
// let result = "fun"
// let thing1 = "lions, zebras, and exotic birds"
// let thing2 = "a really fat capybara"
// let result2 = "happy"
// alert(`Hi! Last week I went ${activity}. My friend ${buddy} and I had so much ${result}. There were ${thing1} and ${thing2}. When we saw it we felt really ${result2}. You should come next time!`)
