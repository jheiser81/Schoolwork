Loops exercises: (Flow chart and Pseudo-code. Make both, and start with the one you are most comfortable)
1) Add all the numbers from 1 - 100 using a For loop, variables, and output

2) Imagine you are at a sporting event where people are doing the High Jump.
You are given the data at the end of the event so you can put it into a program you are making.
For our purposes here, every number will have to be input by hand and will be checked inside the loop. (Basically put a "user input" inside the loop to take in the new data).
After you input the first number it will be stored as the biggest number.
When you input your second number you will have to check if it is bigger than the first, if it is bigger store it as the biggest number.
Imagine you are checking (inputting) 10 numbers for the highest number
Case 1) Input = 55,88,33,66,45,100,2,78,52,1
           Output = 100
Case 2) 1000,555,951,-2,321,0,7,5,333,99
           Output =
