1) Fill in the Truth Table in the Slides

In your own words:
2) Explain XOR
Requires an exact (T or F) or (F or T) to output a T. if we have (T and T) or (F and F) we output F
3) Explain AND
-Require P and Q to Be T for us to output T (T,  T). All other combinations will output F (F, F) or (T, F) or (F, T). 
-The output will be true only if both input values are true. Otherwise, we will output false
4) Explain OR
-OR requires only one promise to be true, (T, T) or (T, F) or (F, T) to output true otherwise it will output false (F, F)
5) Explain Negation
Is the opposite of what is input, if we input a T we get an F, and if we input a F we will get a T.
6) Explain NOR
NOR is the opposite of OR, this requires P and Q to be false to be True, So (F, T) OR (T, F) OR (T,T) will output false
7) Explain Unary operator
We have one input for the operator
8) Explain Binary operator
we have two inputs for our operator

What do these tables represent (AND, OR, xOR...etc)?
9) AND
T   T = T
F   F = F
F   T = F
T   F = F

10) OR
T   T = T
F   F = F
F   T = T
T   F = T
11) XOR
T   T = F
F   F = F
F   T = T
T   F = T
Extra concept to look up
12)XNOR
T   T = T
F   F = T
F   T = F
T   F = F
