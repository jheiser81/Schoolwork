Exercise 1:


Create
an array of 10 unique numbers from 0 - 20, count how many odd numbers, even
numbers (that aren’t zero) and zeros there are in the array.

an array of 100 random numbers, then calculate how many odd numbers, even
numbers (even excluding 0) and zeros there are in the array.
Exercise

Use
the same array in exercise 2 to check for the largest number, smallest number,
add the whole array together, and find the average.
