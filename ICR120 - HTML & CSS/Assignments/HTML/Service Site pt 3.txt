Add 3 pages to your sites in the same directory as your index.html file:
For cleaning:
Pages(based on <a> tags):
Contact, About and Pricing
in contact:
Add a form that includes:
first name, last name
I want you to research other contact forms from other sites, see what they have and try to add other things to your form(radio buttons,  checkboxes, etc...)
For portfolio:
Pages:
Contact, About and Projects (projects will be where you add the projects we make in class)
And do the same for the form portion as you did for the cleaning site.
