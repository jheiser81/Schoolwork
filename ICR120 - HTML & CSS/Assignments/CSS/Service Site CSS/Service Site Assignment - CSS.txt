Make a zip file of the HTML portion of your site

This will be "Version Control" for the HTML portion. This is for you to keep (and then later upload to GitHub), do not submit the html.zip file.

Then add CSS to the original file:
-Background color
- padding, margin, border, outline, border-radius
- flexbox
and submit your CSS work as a zip file
